# My Portfolio - First Trial

This project is a professional portfolio designed to showcase a developer's skills and talents. The portfolio is built from scratch, applying the core skills recently learned: flexbox, media queries, and CSS variables.


## Objective

Create a responsive and visually appealing professional portfolio website using HTML and CSS. The portfolio should showcase your skills, experience, and projects in a clear and engaging manner.


## Features

- Developer's Information: The portfolio presents the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them.
- Navigation: The portfolio includes a navigation bar with links to different sections of the site.
- Work Section: The portfolio includes a section dedicated to the developer's work. This section contains titled images of the developer's applications.
- Responsive Layout: The portfolio is designed to be responsive, meaning it adapts to different screen sizes and devices.

## Issues

Having trouble getting my name and the links across from each other opposed to below it.
Trying to split the webpage 25%-75% but also having difficulty with that.
Got scrolling to work for the images but it only appears when hovering over the bottom image. I think I need to add more picturess. I've only linked the first image, it opens to the first homework repository.


## Resources

Used Phind.com, W3schools.com, and previous activities as guides.
