# Challenge-Wk2

Created a webpage about myself. Used Phind.com, W3schools.com, and previous activities as guides.

Having trouble getting my name and the links across from each other opposed to below it.
Trying to split the webpage 25%-75% but also having difficulty with that.
Got scrolling to work for the images but it only appears when hovering over the bottom image. I think I need to add more picturess. I've only linked the first image, it opens to the first homework repository.
